# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning (biomedical data analysis)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using clinical patient data and machine learning techniques.  
It was developed as part of my preparation for graduate studies in **Biomedical Engineering**, with an emphasis on applying data science to healthcare problems.

## 🫀 Motivation
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide.  
Early detection using clinical indicators can significantly improve patient outcomes.  
This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in medical decision support systems.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset (Cleveland)
- Number of samples after cleaning: 299
- Target variable:
  - has_disease = 1` → presence of heart disease  
  - has_disease = 0` → no heart disease

## 🧪 Features Used
- Age
- Resting blood pressure (`trestbps`)
- Cholesterol level (`chol`)
- Maximum heart rate (`thalch`)
- ST depression (`oldpeak`)
- Number of major vessels (`ca`)

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Feature selection
- Train-test split (80% train / 20% test)
- Model: **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluation metric: **Accuracy**

## 📈 Results
- Model Accuracy: **78.3%**
- The model shows a reasonable performance for a baseline medical classification task.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add ROC curve and confusion matrix
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning
- Clinical interpretation of feature importance

## 🎓 Academic Relevance
This project reflects my interest in combining **machine learning and biomedical data analysis**, and serves as an introductory study for graduate-level research in biomedical engineering and health informatics.
