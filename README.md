# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques.  
It is designed as a **biomedical data science project**, combining healthcare data analysis with supervised learning.

The main goal is to demonstrate how machine learning can assist in **early detection of cardiovascular diseases**, which is a critical topic in biomedical engineering.

---

## 🧠 Motivation
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide.  
Early diagnosis can significantly improve treatment outcomes.

This project was developed as a **portfolio and academic project** to support future studies in **Biomedical Engineering and Health Informatics**, particularly at the graduate (Master’s) level.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Heart Disease Dataset
- Number of samples: ~900
- Target variable:
  - `has_disease = 1` → Patient has heart disease
  - `has_disease = 0` → Patient does not have heart disease

### Selected Features:
- Age
- Resting blood pressure (`trestbps`)
- Cholesterol level (`chol`)
- Maximum heart rate (`thalch`)
- ST depression (`oldpeak`)
- Number of major vessels (`ca`)

---

## ⚙️ Methods
- Data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Feature selection
- Train-test split
- Logistic Regression model
- Model evaluation using accuracy

---

## 📈 Results
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: **~78%**

This result shows that even a simple linear model can capture meaningful patterns in medical data.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)
- Feature scaling and normalization
- ROC-AUC analysis
- Cross-validation
- Clinical interpretation of model coefficients
